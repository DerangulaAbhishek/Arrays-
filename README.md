An indexed data structure to hold homogeneous data with fixed in size.
==> Indexed
==> Homogeneous
==> fixed
Steps Of Array :-
1. Declaration of Array.
2. Creation of Array.
3. Initialization of Array.

1.Declaration of Array :- 

        Int [ ] arr;

2.Creation Of Array :- 

arr =new int [size of Array]

Declaration and Creation part can be written in one line 
 
         Int arr[ ]=new int [size of Array]

3.Initialization of Array :-      


for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)   
{
   int[i]=30;
}
